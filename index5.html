    As I was going down impassive Rivers, 
    <br>I no longer felt myself guided by haulers: 
    <br>Yelping redskins had taken them as targets 
    <br>
    And had nailed them naked to colored stakes.
</div>
<br><br>
<div id="v3">
    I was indifferent to all crews,<br>
The bearer of Flemish wheat or English cottons<br>
When with my haulers this uproar stopped<br>
The Rivers let me go where I wanted.
</div>

<br><br>
<div id="v4">Into the furious lashing of the tides<br>
    More heedless than children's brains the other winter<br>
    I ran! And loosened Peninsulas<br>
    Have not undergone a more triumphant hubbub</div><br><br>
<div id="v5">The storm blessed my sea vigils<br>
    Lighter than a cork I danced on the waves<br>
    That are called eternal rollers of victims,<br>
    Ten nights, without missing the stupid eye of the lighthouses!
     </div><br><br>
<div id="v6">Sweeter than the flesh of hard apples is to children<br>
    The green water penetrated my hull of fir<br>
    And washed me of spots of blue wine<br>
    And vomit, scattering rudder and grappling-hook</div><br><br>
<div id="v7">I have seen sidereal archipelagos! and islands<br>
    Whose delirious skies are open to the sea-wanderer:<br>
    —Is it in these bottomless nights that you sleep and exile yourself,<br>
    Million golden birds, o future Vigor? –<br>
     </div><br><br>
<div id="v8">But, in truth, I have wept too much! Dawns are heartbreaking.<br>
    Every moon is atrocious and every sun bitter.<br>
    Acrid love has swollen me with intoxicating torpor<br>
    O let my keel burst! O let me go into the sea!</div>
